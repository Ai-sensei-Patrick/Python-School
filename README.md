# Python-School

This is a group project that I did in my university, Please read the csv version instead of the jupyter notebook version, since the csv version contain all conclusion needed. 
The jupyter notebook used to show the code is working.

Business problem:
The California Department of Education (www.cde.ca.gov) is interested in the effect of  school  class  sizes  on  test  scores  for  school  age  children.   
They  also  wish  to  build a  model  that  can  accurately  predict  test  scores  for  school  age  children  
so  they  can better understand the drivers of student academic performance.

Conduct a suitable exploratory analysis on this dataset that is relevant to the goals of this business problem.

Analyse  and  test  for  a  relationship  between  class  size  and  average  test  scores. Include a discussion of whether the assumptions of your analysis and test could hold for this data and whether and how strongly the data actually fits the model. 

Discuss which variables in the dataset, could be causing omitted variable bias in our analysis. Include these omitted variables, together with class size, in a multiple  regression  model. Fit the model, without  any  transformations  or  interactions  or  nonlinear  effects. Test for a relationship between class size and test score. Discussion of whether the assumptions of your test could hold for this data and whether and how well the data actually fits the model. Discuss the level and sources of multi-collinearity present in the data and our analysis.

Conduct a variable and model selection exercise, including at least two potential interaction effects as potential predictors and also at least two transformations/nonlineareffects as potential inclusions. A summary of the comparison of fit over at least 8 different models/transformations/variable sets that have been tried, all while forcing class size to stay in the model in some form. The goal is to find an optimal model that is highly accurate, but also parsimonious, to predict and explain the  average test scores. Briefly discussing any collinearity issues it may have and also nonlinear effect in the model.

Prediction of what would result if the student-teacher ratiowas reduced by 1 student, on average in each district, using the optimal model.

Using the 5 best model specifications considered so far, generate forecast predictions in the “test” dataset for the average5th grade reading and math scores. This shown by summary table, and plot(s), of the forecasts and their accuracy for these models, using the forecast measures RMSE,MAD and forecastR2.

Discusses and summarises our analysis above  and conclusions on the  overall goals of this  study. Our report include a prediction of what would likely occur if the department spent money on hiring more teachers, so as  to  reduce class size,  and recommend what action they should take or suggestions for how the Department could further assist school age children improving their average maths and readings scores and also any suggestions they should do to facilitate that
